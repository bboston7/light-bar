LIGHT BAR
=========

This project is a collection of files for interfacing with an arduino with an
addressable light strip (I have the LPD8806).  If your model varies, you may
need to alter the ino code.

GOAL
----
The eventual goal is to get have each led on the strip correspond to a different
frequency band and vary in intensity and color based off of raw audio data
from my computer.  Right now, the code is incomplete and kind of ugly, but it
will be improved.

PULL REQUESTS
-------------
If you write something cool that uses the light_bar_controller, please submit
a pull request and I'll take a look at it!  The bar can do much more than music
of course, and many of my own scripts have nothing to do with music.
