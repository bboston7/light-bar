Arduino side:
    Listen on serial port for enums
    setSolid(color, priority) - to light bar all one color
    setProgress(percentage, priority) - light like a progress par
    reset() - Reset bar to blank state and priority
    setCustom(color[], priority) - set each LED

Python client:
    Main controller that expands on basic arduino functions
        setSolid(color, priority)
        setProgress(partial, whole, priority)
        setCustom(colors, priority)
    send data over serial
    Individual application level controllers that talk to main controller
        failed command
        irssi highlight
        portage status
        mpd progress
        pulseaudio levels (very hard, maybe impossible with serial speed)
        Vol up/down bar
